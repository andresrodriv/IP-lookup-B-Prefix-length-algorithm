# IP-lookup-B-Prefix-length-algorithm
This project was developed by the students of Politecino di Milano, for the Switching and Routing course:
FRANCESCO LATEANO, 913035
ANDRÉS FELIPE RODRÍGUEZ VANEGAS, 915761
NICOLAS BORRERO ROMERO, 913297

The goal of the project is the implementation of two IP algorithms, binary trie and binary search on prefix length, in order to perform address lookup using them and studying their performances in comparison with their theoretical counterparts.
In order to do so, we worked with the following tools:
Mininet: creates a realistic virtual network environment (switches, routers, and their links) on a single machine.
Ryu: the SDN controller that is connected to the simulated virtual network in order for us to perform routing with our algorithms.
BitVise: it gives access to internet to the virtual machine and opens external SSH connections. Assists as well in the creation of multiple terminal windows to handle the different applications.
